# cola-craft-cans
## Backend
Cola craft cans is a recommendation app for craft beers. A user selects a few criteria and beers they already know they like and the app will recommend new beers based on those parameters. Right now, we have a dataset of about five thousand beers in a mongodb database, and code to query and return beers based on relevance. In the future, we plan to build out an API so that the front end code, written in swift for iOS, can communicate with the backend and provide a clean UI for our users.
